## Development Commands

### Commit Message Guidelines
- Use conventional commit format with lowercase prefixes: `fix:`, `feat:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Write commit messages as single sentences without bullet points
- Example: `fix: resolve overlapping FAB buttons by moving add event functionality to app level`

### Testing & Quality
```bash
# Run tests
flutter test

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Check for outdated dependencies
flutter pub outdated

# Update dependencies
flutter pub upgrade
```

### Data Management
```bash
# Run data migration scripts
dart run scripts/migrate_events.dart
```

## Data Structure

### Event Model
Events support both point events (earthquakes) and period events (eruptions):
```json
{
  "id": "ev_2025_01_15_etna_earthquake_001",
  "title": "M 4.2 earthquake near Etna",
  "type": "point", // or "period"
  "location": {
    "name": "Sicily, Italy",
    "lat": 37.7513,
    "lng": 14.9934
  },
  "dateRange": {
    "start": "2025-01-15T21:45:00Z",
    "end": "2025-01-15T22:00:00Z" // for period events
  },
  "uniqueData": {
    "magnitude": 4.2,
    "depthKm": 10.5,
    "region": "Etna"
  }
}
```

### Assets
- **data.json**: Legacy event data format
- **events.json**: Current event data with v2 structure
- **users.json**: User account information
- **groups.json**: User group definitions
- **volcano_graph_image.webp**: Application imagery

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Custom window controls with `bitsdojo_window`
- Resizable split views optimized for desktop interaction
- Keyboard shortcuts and desktop-specific UI patterns
- Initial window size: 1200x800, minimum: 900x600

### Mobile (iOS/Android)
- Touch-optimized gestures for map interaction
- Responsive layout adaptation for smaller screens
- Platform-specific icons and styling

### Web
- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Web-optimized performance and rendering
- Browser compatibility across modern web browsers

## Development Tips

### Debugging and Testing
- **Let the user handle app execution**: Do not attempt to run, debug, or hot reload the Flutter app yourself
- User will provide debug output and test results
- Focus on code analysis and fixes based on user feedback
- Add temporary print statements for debugging when needed (user will run and provide output)

### Working with BLoC
- Use `MultiBlocProvider` in main.dart for dependency injection
- Follow the established pattern: Event → Bloc → State → UI
- Utilize `BlocBuilder` and `BlocListener` for reactive UI updates

### Map Integration
- Events are displayed as markers with clustering support
- Map state is synchronized with timeline selection
- Custom markers for different event types and magnitudes

### Event Comparison
- Recently viewed events are automatically tracked
- Comparison mode allows side-by-side event analysis
- Floating comparison list shows selected events

### Navigation System
- Page-based navigation with dynamic nav items
- State preservation across page switches
- Split view ratios are maintained per session

## Performance Considerations
- Event data is loaded efficiently with repository pattern
- Map markers use clustering to handle large datasets
- State management minimizes unnecessary rebuilds
- Asset optimization for cross-platform deployment
