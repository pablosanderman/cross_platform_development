# Feedback Fixes Implementation

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ X Button Position
- **Issue**: X button was on the top-left
- **Fix**: Moved X button to the top-right corner of the event details panel
- **File**: `lib/shared/view/event_details_panel.dart`

### 2. ✅ Map Event Details Flow
- **Issue**: Event details opened directly on map marker click, bypassing the popup
- **Fix**: Restored original popup flow:
  - Map marker click → Opens popup (existing behavior)
  - Popup title/image click → Opens event details panel
- **Files Modified**:
  - `lib/map/view/map_page.dart` - Restored original popup triggers
  - `lib/map/view/event_popup.dart` - Made title and image clickable to trigger details

### 3. ✅ Split Screen Overlay Behavior
- **Issue**: Event details replaced the other panel instead of overlaying
- **Fix**: Implemented true overlay behavior:
  - Both timeline and map remain visible underneath
  - Event details appears as overlay on appropriate side
  - Closing details restores original split-screen state
  - Added shadow effects for visual separation

#### Implementation Details:
- **State Management**: Added `previousShowTimeline` and `previousShowMap` fields to store state before details
- **Layout Logic**: Changed from replacement to overlay using positioned widgets with shadows
- **Navigation Logic**: 
  - Show details: Store current state, ensure both views visible, show overlay
  - Close details: Restore previous state exactly as it was
  - Switch views: Simply change overlay position

#### Spatial Behavior:
- **Timeline event click**: Details overlay appears on right side (over map area)
- **Map event click**: Details overlay appears on left side (over timeline area)
- **Close button**: Returns to exact previous view state (preserves user's original layout)

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Proper Event Discovery Flow**: Users browse map events via popups, then click for details
2. **Context Preservation**: Original split-screen state is perfectly preserved
3. **Visual Clarity**: Shadow effects clearly distinguish overlay from background
4. **Spatial Consistency**: Details always appear opposite to source, building muscle memory
