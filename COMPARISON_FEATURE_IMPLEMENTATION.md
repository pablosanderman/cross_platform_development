# Event Comparison Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive event comparison feature for the volcano monitoring dashboard following the exact specifications provided. The feature consists of three main components integrated seamlessly with the existing BLoC architecture.

## ✅ Implemented Components

### 1. Floating Comparison List (Bottom-Right)
**Location**: `lib/comparison/widget/floating_comparison_list.dart`

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Fixed floating widget in bottom-right corner (only on timeline/map page)
- ✅ Accordion-style collapsible/expandable list with smooth animations
- ✅ Header showing count (e.g., "2 Items - Compare list")
- ✅ Individual event cards with remove buttons (X)
- ✅ "Compare" button that navigates to comparison results
- ✅ "Add More" button to open selection overlay
- ✅ Empty state with helpful messaging and "Add Events" button
- ✅ Maximum of 10 events with appropriate error handling
- ✅ Persistent state across different pages/routes

### 2. Comparison Selection Overlay
**Location**: `lib/comparison/widget/comparison_selection_overlay.dart`

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Black transparent background overlay (opacity ~0.7)
- ✅ Centered white modal container with rounded corners
- ✅ "Add Events to Compare" header with close button (X)
- ✅ Current comparison list display with remove functionality
- ✅ Real-time search functionality by name, location, region
- ✅ Recently viewed events in 3x3 grid (9 total)
- ✅ Event cards with add buttons (+)
- ✅ Prevents adding duplicate events
- ✅ Shows "max limit reached" messaging
- ✅ Handles empty states with appropriate messaging
- ✅ Loading states during search operations

### 3. Comparison Results Page
**Location**: `lib/comparison/view/comparison_results_page.dart`

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ New route (`/comparison`) with proper navigation
- ✅ App bar with back button, "Event Comparison" title, and close button
- ✅ Event summary cards showing compared events
- ✅ **General Information Table** with:
  - Location, Event Type, Start Time, End Time
  - Description, Region, and other basic attributes
- ✅ **Specific Information Table** with:
  - Dynamic attribute mapping from event properties
  - Event-specific attributes (magnitude, depth, temperature, etc.)
  - Proper formatting for different data types
  - Uses "—" for non-applicable attributes
- ✅ Responsive table design with proper column sizing
- ✅ Empty state handling when no events to compare

## ✅ Integration Points

### 1. Navigation Integration
**Files Modified**: `lib/app.dart`, `lib/main.dart`

- ✅ Added comparison routes to existing navigation system
- ✅ Integrated ComparisonPage wrapper around timeline/map view
- ✅ Deep linking support for `/comparison` route
- ✅ Proper back button and close button handling

### 2. Event Model Extensions
**Files**: `lib/comparison/models/comparison_event_item.dart`

- ✅ Created ComparisonEventItem wrapper with metadata
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with existing Event model
- ✅ No modifications needed to existing event structure

### 3. State Management
**Files**: `lib/comparison/bloc/comparison_bloc.dart`, `comparison_state.dart`, `comparison_event.dart`

- ✅ Created ComparisonBloc following existing BLoC pattern
- ✅ Integrated with existing BLoC providers in main.dart
- ✅ Handles state persistence across app lifecycle
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

### 4. UI Consistency
**Integration**: All comparison components follow existing design patterns

- ✅ Uses existing color scheme and typography
- ✅ Follows current button and card designs
- ✅ Maintains responsive design patterns
- ✅ Consistent with existing UI/UX

### 5. Timeline Integration
**Files Modified**: `lib/timeline/view/timeline_view.dart`

**Features Added**:
- ✅ Hover actions showing "Add to Compare" button on events
- ✅ Context menu (right-click/long-press) with comparison options
- ✅ Visual feedback for different states (added, available, max reached)
- ✅ Automatic marking of viewed events for recently viewed tracking
- ✅ Integration with existing hover and selection system

## ✅ Data Requirements

### 1. Recently Viewed Events
**File**: `lib/comparison/models/recently_viewed_service.dart`

- ✅ Implemented tracking service for viewed events
- ✅ Stores last 20 viewed events (shows 9 in UI)
- ✅ Persistent data using local file storage
- ✅ Handles web platform gracefully

### 2. Event Attributes Mapping
**Implementation**: Dynamic attribute extraction in comparison tables

- ✅ Mapping system for general attributes (location, event type, etc.)
- ✅ Handles event-type specific attributes dynamically
- ✅ Proper formatting for different data types (numbers, booleans, strings)
- ✅ Gracefully handles missing or non-applicable attributes with "—"

## ✅ File Structure Created
